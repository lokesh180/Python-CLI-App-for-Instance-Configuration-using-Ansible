---Instructions for Execution---
Creating a SSH public key
1.  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    ssh-keygen -t dsa 
    ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 
choose one amoung i did with ecdsa algorithm.
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/key.pub -t ecdsa -b 521
2. Then copying key to instances by using the command
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/key.pub user@host(localhost in my case)
3. Making the user(connected via ssh) sudo for that Creating a new file (named user name) in sudoers.d
   and writing "<username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" and then we are making the user not to ask password.
